The Startup industry is dynamically changing and adopting new technologies and methodologies at a fast pace. That makes it difficult to gage what the most in-demand skills are at a given point in time. We built Vennio to let users gage the Startup landscape in terms of what skills are trending, how many companies are hiring for those skills, and how much on average they're willing to pay for them.
